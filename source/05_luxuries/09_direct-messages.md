#### DMs

There will be great pressure to immediately respond to DMs and texts, but this may not always be 
inyour best interest. Is your room clean? It should be before you even open your inbox. If your 
absense becomes disturbing to them, then the question becomes why they aren’t helping you if you’re
so overwhelmed. In many cases there are good answers,especially in professional settings.
