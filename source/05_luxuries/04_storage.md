#### Storage

Excess belongings can be kept with a relative or friend in some cases, and for everything else there 
are storage units. A 5x5x8” unit can be enough for a professional wardrobe, some items to flip, a 
pantry to store bulk food, personal documents, and anything else that might be kept in a fixed 
dwelling. Depending on location, it can be accessed daily or weekly and built into the routine.
Prior to storage, belongings are limited to what we can carry around with us. 
In my experience it’s better to pay a storage company than to depend on relatives or friends. 
Depending upon the circumstances of being without fixed shelter, people may turn on an unhoused 
person for optical reasons alone. 
Like with cafes, too much exposure to the staff can create a reverse halo effect. They may be 
accustomed to homeless people ‘abusing’ access to their storage space, as it’s known in the 
mainstream that sometimes homeless people sneak into storage units.
