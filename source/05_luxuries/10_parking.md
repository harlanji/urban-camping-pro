#### Parking

Abide by local parking restrictions and use camp site rules.
Depending where you park people will have different reactions. People will stare at you and if you 
stare back at them then it’s strange. I’m not using a common device to write this, so it could be hard 
for people to figure out what I am doing in my car.
Heat becomes an issue later in the day. This can help some things like bathing and keeping the 
internal temperature up. It also makes air become too hot, which can be remedied with an air 
conditioner at the cost of adding exhaust gas and extra tear on the engine, like the coolant and oil 
(“idle hours” is the technical term).
Window cracks provide air flow. For a portable heater to work there needs to be X square inches of 
cracks.
Parking atop a hill is good for safety. It makes the psychology easier. It’s a natural barrier that deters 
people from getting close. Naturally they can only exist on 1 or 2 sides of the car, usually the 
passenger side and then front or rear. Walls are another feature, for example a retaining wall or a wall 
or hedges.
Trees can provide shade. If you’re using a screen then this can be a bonus. If you are using solar then 
it can be a hinder if your batteries need charging.
It may be useful to create a map or list of parking spots, as a new routine can wash the memory of the 
old.

[ TABLE ]

The main factors to parking are weather, safety, amenities. Safety can extend beyond the common sense
dangerous minorities. In the avenues of a city people may belong to secret societies and use them as 
extra-judicial enforcement through neighborhood watch-type programs. Parking by a bus stop is a good idea. Neighbors can’t complain much. Drivers may come to recognize 
and resent you. Activities can be planned by their season. Laundry may wait over night and be strange 
to put away at night and look lazy if not done by afternoon.
