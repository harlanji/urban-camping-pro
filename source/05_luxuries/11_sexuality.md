Sex
Perhaps more controversial than the Potty situation is the Sex situation. They say that it is a basic 
physical need on the order of Food. Does that ring true? That all depends. It may sound good for a 
housed person in a functional life. But should homeless people be thinking about it and acting on 
those thoughts? What do you think when you see a pregnant woman with a cardboard sign that is 
begging for money? How would you feel if two VanLifers met up and the cradle started rocking? Do 
we let homeless people adopt pets? If not then why should they be engaging in activity that brings a 
little human to life? At very least they should be able to afford a motel if they’re engaging in such 
activity. If sex is a basic human need then we need to accommodate it for all people. Like safe 
injection sites for drugs, should we allow free access to conjugal visit areas? Indeed, are all inmates 
entitled to conjugal visits with their wives? Is masturbation endorsed and accommodated? We’re told 
that masturbation is healthy and “cleans the pipes”… should we expect that homeless people are 
doing it in their tents? Van dwellers in their van? 
My personal opinion is that no, we should not accommodate it. Yet I’m happy to mention it because 
it’s a question that may burn in everyone’s mind, or maybe I am just a thorough pervert for 
considering the full hierarchy of so-called basic human needs. Plenty of literature can be found on 
semen retention, and indeed depending on the level of woo that the reader can accept they may buy 
the idea that manifestation ability can be increased by retaining seed. When do you think the last time 
Jesus jacked off was when he turned water into wine? The last time ___ spanked it before he parted 
the sea? One need not subscibe to biblical understanding to ralize the benefits of semen retention—
turn only to the simpsons [homer simpson semen retention clip]. Similar to having a child, if one can 
not afford shelter then they should not put energy into pleasuring themselves. The result of retention 
has an evolutionary advantage, again, whether one believes in evolution or not, one can not deny the 
connection between increased focus and mental clarity accomplished by semen retention and 
productivity required to improve one’s life situation.No doubt law enforcement would agree with my stance whatever their personal beliefs: homeless 
people and van dwellers should not be wanking. The case of van dwellers who are making a good 
living and can afford fixed shelter should include a motel budget if they want to spank the monkey.
