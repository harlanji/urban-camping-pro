#### Electricity

Electricity is like water. It can be collected from the sun or originate in a central location and flows 
through a grid like water. Aside from hostile architecture preventing homeless loitering, it flows at 
cafes and libraries for all use use freely. Hostile architecture may be removal of outlets and covering
them with plates, and the point of limiting it isn’t so much to stop people from drinking it as it is to 
stop the loitering. In general, we think of it as a free resource and take its essential nature in modern 
existence forgranted.
During lockdown, electricity has been experienced as basic human need and the zeitgeist has not yet
caught up—who view cell phones as a luxury, and time on Twitter as socializing.
2 160 watt hour+ batteries are recommended. A place to cycle them each day or each two days 
should be enough to power a phone and CarPuter or iPad-like tablt. The experience is may concrete 
by the homeless who may no longer loiter in libraries or cafes which are closed to seating.
