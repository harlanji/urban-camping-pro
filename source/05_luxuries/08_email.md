#### Email

Email access will not be as regular as may be demanded by the job market. This is a hidden 
problem. Is it more important to respond to an email, or to finish cleaning oneâ€™s space and dumping 
out the shit, and cleaning oneself? This may create a several hour turn around time.
With modification to eating schedule it may be possible to be clean and done shitting by 9am each 
day. But it is currently a biological limitaion, which will require an adaptation to my overall system.
There may be opportunity cost, such as working only being possible during hours that are warm 
enough or cool enough, or with accommodating temp control done economically.
