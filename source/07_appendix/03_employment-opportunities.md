It feels like mental squander and to a person who is naturally productive it feels like missed 
opportunity. When homeless and without income, people are also critical of how time is spent so it 
can feel isolating to be unable to interact with people naturally and while in violation of the social 
contract. During so-called worker shortages it can appear to others as though one is choosing to not 
work. When the weather is just right and one has access to a shower and the proper clothing then 
they can seek work; when that’s not the case, one can not present themselves well and will find it 
harder to get work and make so-called choose to not seek it. Indeed, a homeless person has a limited
radius of travel constrained by budget and geography and can not show up to the same places to 
apply more than one in a short period [This should perhaps go in another section related to 
homelessness or socializing in the homeless specific work].
The time of day can play a major role in temperature. Long days will give more working hours, but 
there may also be a longer gap of heat and direct sunlight in the middle of the day. This may be good
for charging batteries from the drive alternator and running errands, but cause some confusion 
during transition periods like spring and fall where day length can change by around a minute per 
day. If doing professional work, it’s good to start early in the morning and wrap it up by the peak of 
the day’s heat. The heat will linger for some time. Sitting in lingering heat can cause excess wear to 
electronics, consumes more battery due to inefficiencies from thermal properties, etc.One need not feel like people like them for security to realize that they need to be liked in order to 
be employed. How can they become likable when nobody likes them and they’re isolated?
