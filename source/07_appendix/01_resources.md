### Appendix: Resources

The website at the beginning of the book [may, soon,] aggregate resources with geographical 
connection. The book was crafted in San Francisco originally which is a neutral location in many 
dimensions (ie. experimentally controlled). The resource availability is also scare though not desolate 
and there are many intelligent and adaptable people there. The guide needs work extending into wider
ranges of clime and resource availability. For example, Minneapolis provides an example of a place 
with less contentious space and ample resource availability. Indeed, we want to keep the parasites 
away (weirdos are okay, like Canadians and perhaps whatever the hell Austin people are calledâ€”oh 
yea, weirdos).
