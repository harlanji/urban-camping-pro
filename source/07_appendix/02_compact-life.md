### Appendix: Compact Life

Similar to Van Life, compact life is life on wheels. It is derived from a common route into 
homelessness, which is dwelling in car. The next alternative is living in a tent. Beyond that is rough 
sleeping. Next up might be Truck or Van Life, followed by RV Life and into Motels, Hotels, SROs, 
AirBnBs, HotelTonights, …, apartments, condos, town-homes, homes,….
Compact is a word with multiple widely used meanings. Compact Life starts with a person’s present 
situation and builds them into the ideal person, through a few principles and a progression of habits. 
Based around existing theories with some innovation in presentation, Compact Life is woven 
throughout this guide as it was developed in concordance with the hardware used to author this work.
Editing. Editing is challenging in limited power situations. CarPuter was developed as a single 
portable platform that expands with resources available. It consumes low power and is expandible to 
large screens when available. This eliminates data migration concerns such as bandwidth and 
processing that can be a bottleneck to applications like iCloud storage.
Travel. Travel requires resources such as Money and Time. It may be taken forgranted by “spoiled” 
people with enough resources 
Controversy. This work was not developed without controversy. Humble author had left tech and been
living in his car for some time before the pandemic hit, but due to constraints created was forced to 
build suitable IT to train for and apply for jobs, and other tasks described in this work. Being on the 
Internet and once influential and popular there were many eyes and great criticism happening behind 
the scenes, and seemingly many false stories running to fit a narrative of the author as being dishonest
and lacking work ethic. The zeitgest of pandemic, worker shortage, and character attacks were enough
to make author experience what can best be described as “gang stalking,” and due to the illegal nature
of such activity it is impossible to get facts on the source of perhaps multiple gangs beyond the 
discernment and insights from meditation of the monkly author. More will be published along this 
vein in the future under the Physics of Homelessness or perhaps Doing Business While Homeless 
lines of work. Businesses face adversity and that may have been one sect launching campaigns 
against the author, who created these works in Big Tech territory after being ejected by a powerful 
man in Big Tech.
