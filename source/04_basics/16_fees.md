#### Fees

Late fees can quickly become a part of life. Federal Poverty is about $1,500/mo and this is a bare 
minimum that doesn’t include much reinvestment. This topic will be covered extensively in the next 
guide but for now we’ll just assume that federal poverty has a basis and I’ll assert that it was a good 
baseline. If for example on has a paid off car then the additional money can go into reinvestment such
as education or nicer wardrobe and shoes if one is educated, and on up the latter.
