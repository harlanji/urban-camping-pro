### Water

In the absence of all else, water is required to survive and sustain a fast. In the event of low savings, 
it is wise to prepare for a 3-5 day fast. If possible, one can keep $3 for an emergency coconut water 
and have enough water on hand, about 0.75 gallons per day.
Bathing takes about 2 gallons of water per week, vs. showering daily at 30+ gallons per shower. 
Very green and eco friendly. This makes urban camping a good approach. Apparently using plain 
waiter may be good, and recent cultural norms are shifting to more lax bathing.
