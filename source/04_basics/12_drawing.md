#### Drawing

Drawing is more basic than writing, so much of the writing section could go here and refer back.
There is paper and electronic drawing.
Illustration can be done on paper or digitally. Digital illustration requires similar to Email. It may 
also require shade so that the screen is more visible with normal conditions. It may also require 
more power for rasterization, space for paper drafts, special purpose peripials that are senitive to 
shocks and humidity, etc.
Drawing is before writing because it was the precursor to writing. People who can read this book 
may not necessarily be able to write, but they can draw pictures whatever language or literacy level.
