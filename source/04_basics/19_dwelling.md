#### Dwelling

Up until this point, everything we’ve done can be done without shelter but shelter. Shelter can be a 
tarp, a tent, a car, a van, a shelter or church, a couch, a hostel, a motel/hotel, an apartment; a hous 
sitting.
It may be surprising to many that shelter is not the first nor last component of homelessness, but one
of the multitudes somewhere in the middle.Cleaning of the space is required. From belongings in and out, to crumbs, to washing and use 
reminants like crumbs and body hair, to recyclables and sorting. It’s best to have a daily cleaning 
routine of cleaning the carpet and bleaching the touched surfaces like keyboard, phone, steering 
wheel, washing water bottle, etc weekly or regular routine of

Running the engine can generate electricity in a pinch, but one will quickly realize that the exhaust 
gas fills up the environment. Also putting idle hours on a car can be excessive wear and tear, and

If you can’t dwell in your shelter for 24 hours with the waste then you are creating too much or it 
smells too bad and needs to be packed better, accordingly.

Tent cities are where the visible homeless people often stay in practice. Contrary to this, the 
invisible make up the bulk of the homeless population. The visible homeless in cities are the drug addicts who account for 26% of the homeless population. The invisible homeless are better thought 
of as unhoused because they have enough resources to stay out of sight, and a growth mindset that 
helps them blend in. They may be regulars at establishments and hold regular jobs that they fit in at.
Some of the invisible homeless stay in cars or simply on sleeping pads in wooded areas and usually 
arrive after dark and depart before morning light. 
Artificial light was a life changing invention for man kind. For the better? The baseline is what 
you’ve been able to do without it to the point. It’s the main contributor to the next section of the
