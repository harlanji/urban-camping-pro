### Sleep

It’s well known that 8 hours of sleep is the average needed for adults. I’m able to do 2 shorter nights 
(ie. stay up late) if I’m sufficiently rested, and recover within 2-3 days, in a pinch… I think about 1 
or 2 of those per month are sustainable. This could be used to “cram” in a motel room for a single 
night or two, followed by rest days (not replacing the actual rest day).
How do we feel when we see someone laying around all day? Usually not good. So what about Rest 
Days which a god ordained activity? If one has a productive week then they should need a rest day. 
Most people choose Saturday or Sunday for rest day. These are indeed the days that it’s easiest to get
away with it. I’ve found that if I genuinely need to rest then the universe allows it. Life defense, rest 
is an activity that can be executed with success based on karmic balance. Personally I always use 
Saturday as a rest day and nobody has ever bothered me. When I’ve vacuumed on rest day I have 
been bothered and a person walking past my car knocked my mirror forward, ironically enough—
the only time anything like that has happened was to teach me to just rest on rest day, and around 
that time I got into the routine or strictly cleaning on the day prior to rest day (Friday in my case). 
Nobody ever bothered me when I vacuumed on a Friday or rested on a Saturday
