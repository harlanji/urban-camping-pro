### Travel

Travel is the most basic thing we can do, beyond moving the head on our neck. We can walk, ride a 
bicycle or skateboard or roller blade, ride a scooter or a motorcycle, drive a car or pickup truck or 
van or more.
To walk we’ll need some shoes or fancier modes of transportation with routine maintenance. Some 
modes are good for some things, and others for others… some offer expanded horizons. Each have 
time and cost trade-offs. In addition to physical travel, one can think of this book as a mental 
journey from poverty to sustainability,
Travel Principles:
If it fit yesterday then it fits today.
Empty with cycles.
Add with consideration.
Not all offers can be taken, unfortunately.
Similar to leaving things saved so you never wonder.
Leave things as you found themPut them away as if you’ll want them next time.
The table below is an illustration for people unfamiliar with a wide range of travel.

Traveling requires luggage based on what activities are intended for the journey or at the destination 
and how long the stay will be and what resources will be available upon arrival. A letter of intent is a
good framework for thinking about any travel, including for employment. The right to retreat must 
be maintained and generally the best place to retreat is back to the last safe place—animals have an 
instinctive memory of their last safe locations and humans while more complex with Maslow’s 
hierarchy have same same mechanism. A job offer to move 2,000 miles across the country need 
include provisions for it not working out, for example, to avoid a vulnerable situation that can 
amount to being trapped in a slavery situation. God protects yet care must be taken to avoid falling 
into such traps. Time is allowed to test spirits which includes negotiation, and so resistance or 
pressure is a sign that the employer may be of a different spirit (not equally yoked) and the 
arrangement may not be healthy (See also: Offers in prior edition or uncut source material).
