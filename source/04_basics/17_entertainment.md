#### Entertainment

Letâ€™s face it, a small part of each week is devoted to entertainment. Break law for a 16 hour work 
day leaves amounts for around 2.5 hours of time off. Structure it in a way that makes sense.
Drinking alcohol is not part of Urban Camping except perhaps on occasion where housing is 
available for the better part of a week to recover and the cost of the drinks is paid by another party. 
Every dollar counts when living this frugally. In addition to the money and time spent, there is an 
aspect of spiritual purity that is posisoned and makes self-defense physically and socially much 
harder (the physical being a manifestation of the spiritual)
