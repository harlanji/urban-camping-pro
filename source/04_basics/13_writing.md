#### Writing

Writing has been an essential part of civic life since the time of scribes, . From signatures on 
contracts, to book keeping, to communication, to poetry and informational material: the pen is 
mightier than the sword. As we transition from the industrial age into the informatio 
n age, the ride is sure to be bumpy as old paradigms as crushed and old verticals transform to 
accommodate a wider vicabulary and wider and deeper spiriual literacy of an elevating population.
Writing can be done on paper or with IT. There are various sizes and purposed paper, and care must 
be taken to properly manage them including storage and disposal, possibly with the option to scan 
into IT, and the need for inventory. “Where is that paper?” “What is this pile?” “How can I make 
space?” Concepts from computer science can be applied here.
Writing requires a space that has been acclimated to, meaning that it can’t really be expected in the 
first 21 days of homelessness or until the succession of needs and habits have been met consistently 
enough to establish the habit in a sustainable capacity. For example, writing for 1 hour per day in a 
space that’s known to be safe and available is doable, but doing so at a random park with chaotic 
surroundings is not. It may be possible to catch inspiration there, and that kind of serendipity 
requires fast access—this document for example took 5 minutes to open up in a totally controlled 
and peaceful setting with secure power, clean laundry, empty bowels, etc.
Remember how you needed to “get into the groove” to write in University? Well beyond the easily 
attacked emotiional state—yes, it was possible to write while having moods if enough of the rest of 
the needs were met sufficiently. I went through that myself to be an engineer, and have devised a 
taxonomy to quantify these needs and the capabilities that are available when a given set are met.

We’ve covered the bottom layer. Next we’ll go deeper.
Some writing is best done in private. In some cases a privacy screen is not enough. 
Editing as distinct from writing requires more resources such as a larger screen, implying that more 
electricity is needed. Depending on the location electricity can be ample for scarce, and there may 
be gates to pass through for its use such as entering a cafe and abiding by the rules of Rome or 
tapping into a street light in an area with weak police protection or lack of enforcement such as blue 
collar neighborhoods in SF.
Editing within a paragraph, editing the paragraphs within a section, and organizing a book into 
sections are each levels of editing. Adding in supporting evidence and references is another layer 
that requires previewing material as a reader would experience it. Editing within a paragraph may be
possible in a low power environment but not the higher orders of editing. Exchanging emails with 
inline quotations may seem simple to most but requires screen real-estate enough to edit at the 
paragraph levels.
Letter of Intent should be a single page and answer key questions about presence in a given location,
which could be Home or a foreign place for indefinite or bounded time. This letter of intent from myvisit to Minneapolis is an example, perhaps not the best but it is the first one that I wrote and 
includes a brief explanation of what a LoI is and why it would be used. Homeless in particular are 
vulnerable to malicious parties painting false narratives about their behaviour.
Journaling may be a wellness activity based on writing without editing, although keeping a proper 
system of record is a topic all on its own (security, transportation, etc.).
