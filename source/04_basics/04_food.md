### Food
After some days it may be necessary to eat. Immediately cutting out all animal products while 
traveling without fixed accommodations can be wise… they show up more than one might imagine, 
but start with what you can see. Dairy and meat go bad very quickly and with severe consequence; it
takes one experience to realize that this isn’t about saving the animals.
Storage is OK if the temp. remains below 41F, otherwise it should be avoided… all but the softest 
produce is OK after 12 hours, but after 24 hours all bets are off… so planning from dinner to lunch 
is a good idea.
A sink with ice may be enough to keep take out food fresh, if well insulated.
I follow the warrior diet and do it vegan style. Eat in the evening, (3/4).
It’s good to eat as much fresh food as possible. Its alkaline is good for our body. It’s tempting to 
think that eating 2k calories of oatmeal is a way to save money, and indeed it can be used every 
other day or similar for a 25% savings. But one can not survive on non-perishable food for very 
long, while remaining sober and vigilant—almost by definition, there are hard to process 
compounds in the non-perishables that are hard for the body to process ie. take energy that could be 
used for constructive processes in digestion. Oatmeal for example is mucho sugar, and the low sugar
variety is lower calories and thus requires more consumed to match calories and may raise the cost. 
Also, foods like oatmeal that are high in sugar are great before workouts for example, because the 
sugar is used immediately rather than creating stress in the body that manifests as anxiety and 
sweating and more.
Vomit can happen. It’s good to vomit into a bio bag, push out the gas and tie it shut, and then repeat 
to avoid puncture. The cooler the storage location the better, and the more immediate the disposal 
the better as well. A bio bag can hold bile vomit for weeks.
