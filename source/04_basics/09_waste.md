#### Waste

Each day waste should be emptied. From living in a home we may be accustomed to weekly trash 
service, and we may perhaps dump our office trash into a bin when it gets full after weeks or months
or a day if we dispose of food in it. We want to avoid carrying extra trash with us, as it is bad vibes
—takes space, is cluttered, is a task that needs to be done, smells, …. Doing it daily is very good. A 
coffee cup or take-out bag can be used, as its disposal will be part of the days’ needs anyway.
Possible optimization for pissing: put bio bag into bottle. Cap may rip it. Will also be very gross to 
dispose of. For use on private land or similar would be a good trial, but in public does not seem 
plausible.

Every problem can be solved with money. If you can afford to double wrap your poops, for 
example, then you can camp in a space for multiple days instead of having to leave right away. As 
long as the bag is totally sealed the spiritual implications can be minimized (true? Not totally sealed,
in truth).
Accumulating too much waste is a problem, the bigger the space. A Civic can only accumulate a few
days’ worth.A major motivation for this work was seeing bottles of piss next to garbage cans. I wondered how it 
could be done in the least disgusting way possible. Being called mentally ill for shitting in bags and 
not showering and quitting jobs to maintain self respect are fuel that keep the fire burning. As I write
this section considering schedules, I am in a spot that is great except for the occasional smell of 
piss… either from dogs who were walked, or other humans who did not know how bests to piss in a 
bottle.
