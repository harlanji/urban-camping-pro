### Weather

Cover from wind and sun, a blanket, a hooded sweat shirt can make all the difference.
One hour of productivity per day is infinitely more than zero. It can be mentally taxing to focus 
when the weather isn’t great, but everything is in mind. 
 When the weather is just right and one has access to a shower and the proper clothing then they can 
seek work; when that’s not the case, one can not present themselves well and will find it harder to 
get work and make so-called choose to not seek it. Be truthful with yourself and God will allow 
whatever is required.
The time of day can play a major role in temperature. Long days will give more working hours, but 
there may also be a longer gap of heat and direct sunlight in the middle of the day. 
When the hand gets hot, it also sweats which causes grease on the device which may seep inside.
Rainy days can be leveraged for productivity. 
Hot phone. 70 degrees outside, heats up car. Covered windows mean more shade but less 
circulation. Open windows mean air flow but also more wind and noise and less security.
Heat wave. There are microclimates in some places.
Winter. Winter creates an urgent need for resources that in some cases are best met by “digging in 
the garbage” such as returning to an ex partner. God provides and protects, and so if one becomes 
trapped in such a situation then there is a way out yet and hope must be maintained and it is for a 
reason, Karma that must be paid—hard as that is to write and likely read for many (prayer may 
help).Drought. Perhaps a scarcity of food. Extra body weight can perhaps be put on if this is anticipated. 
Artesian wells may provide a life line, so it is good to know where the nearest ones are. Diet may 
have to change in include imported items like dairy or preserved meats, though in all likelihood 
those will run out before dried nuts as people perceive them to have more nutritional value than nuts
and berries. Travel may be required to attain resources from a better climate if camping is 
involuntary such as homelessness or disaster displacement.
40F min daily temperature and above make a reasonable experience living outside. Below that it’s 
uncomfortable to have skin exposed like fingers. 
Have you ever been locked out of your house? That’s the best approximation to what it feels like to 
be homeless. In most peoples’ cases they can afford to call a locksmith or pay the landlord’s fee, 
while they burn an hour or two. Locked out without a mobile? 95% of people will be beyond 
confused and freeze to death in the snow before they consider options for accessing a phone to call a
locksmith or the landlord. What is an option? Walk to a nearby business and ask to use their phone; 
homeless people do this as part of their daily routine.
