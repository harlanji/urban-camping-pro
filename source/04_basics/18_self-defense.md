#### Self Defense

The best defense is to have no karma to pay back. God does not punish sin, but withdraws his 
protection for the aversion of sin. Is a child born with sin? Did the sacrifice of so-called Jesus Christ 
appease God and win his protection despite the aversion to the sin of each person? How does one 
repay karma and invite the return of God and his protection? Perhaps time and fasting are enough, 
and this is the natural result of starvation. Stealing bread to eat is repulsive, as is hustling with 
deception and fear for where one will attain their next meal. Being generous wins the protection of 
God, more so than hoarding and fearing for the protection of resources. We find in this work that 
that there are basics required for survival, so for example if one is in a climate with distinct seasons 
that can not yield crops then a certain amount must be stored to consume during the winter months. 
We think in terms of dollars in the modern age, and that is a reasonable until to represent storage 
when used for commerce. This brings us to the power of the modern age in the next section: 
electricity, which can be used to power a refrigerator or freezer that extends the goods from market 
to days or months. A reasonable storehouse can expect God’s protection, where a storehoue larger 
than one canuse may be invaded by so-called pests or robbed due to squander or greed resulting 
from the excess—sins that repulse God.
If one has Karma to pay then there may be a period where one is open to attack; no weapon formed 
against the righteous shall prosper, but in the period of reaching righteousness karmic matches may 
be met who attempt blows.
