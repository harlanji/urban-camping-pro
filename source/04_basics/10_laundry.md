#### Laundry (Clothes)

Itâ€™s good to have exactly a one week supply of landry, so that a routine can be built where 
everything is watched each week and minimal extra clothing is required.
Fold your clothes when you are done with them. At night, in dirty laundry, right after laundry.
Seasonal choices can make the one week guideline harder to manage, and be accomplished by 
keeping a Storage unit.
