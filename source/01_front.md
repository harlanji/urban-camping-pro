Editing
The approach to editing is: 
 Dump all thoughts and form an organization.
 Put all thoughts related to a section down.
 Reorganize paragraphs that overlap with other sections
 Go through each section with a list of the other sections and make relationships and rewrite.
Creating action items as opposed to editing
 List of sections that need work.
 Incorporation or illustrations for section.
 
Articles and publications for promotion are attached as appendices
Before forwarding to editor
 Filter for content that is too raw / personal or suggests future plans..
