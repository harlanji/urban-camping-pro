## Introduction

How would a professional camp in an urban environment? Camping is a general activity, which 
could be done out of necessity or by choice. Time at camp can include leisure and productive time 
alike. This guide is divided into two parts: “Basics” require no electricity, and “Luxuries” expands 
upon the Basics with electricity and automated services. It is written for a moderate climate (35-
75F); true, in post-pandemic times Electricity and IT are practically basics, but we’ve separated 
them out because it’s a natural way of thinking.
Urban Camping is great in San Francisco, where this guide was written mainly in a Civic during the 
pandemic and edited in motels and while traveling. Dwelling in a vehicle is an excellent option in 
moderate places. With the proper facilities, the vehicle is comfortable for most of the day and can be
left or parked in different places according to desires—sunshine, shade, views, privacy, etc. The 
local homeless population are in tents but their living situation is almost identical except for 
Moving.
Future guides may explore aspects such as Physics and Stealth in detail.

### Science & Law

This work is cross discipline. The processes and methods are informed by Computer Science, which 
explores the other areas in a generally depth-first fashion. Since it is open source and controversial, 
authors may be exposed to liabilities for developing knowledge in public via experimentation. The 
work itself should include proper defense for legitimate efforts, as the impact can be wide—Van Life 
is fun and by choice, but each month an increasing number of people are losing their homes and can 
benefit from this work, which amounts to a net gain to society—more readers, fewer piss bottles near 
trash cans. More understanding of the processes of the universe, easier reflection of the things it 
shows to the reader. (Eg. I never litter, but sometimes water bottles fly out of my bike drink holder… 
yesterday I bought smart water and lost it such, and then later saw smart water bottle on the ground 
somewhere new and of a smaller size… I recall this happening before, feeling like a trend… but then 
the whole download could just include the feeling of having done it before. If I sat for some imnutesI 
eel I could pull the image o the bottle out).
There exist law enforcement databases for people of special interest. One is for people with 
restraining orders, and one can imagine there are more such as released violent offenders. It may be hard to discern what lists exist and that one is on. Some observed effects of being on lists may be 
police presence beyond chance at places that are frequented, unfriendly shop keepers, and other things
that people of color talk about related to “racism.”
Productivity
Habits are the #1 way to unlock productivity. Intensity beats consistency every time (Bruce Lee), and 
programming based on scheduling needs and preferences can dominate gains made by 
inconveniencing oneself and working up will (Ms. Olympia 2x).
Developing one habit at a time is the best way to reach self actualization, and each habit can require 
from about 7 to 40 repetitions the first time with so-called muscle memory kicking in on subsequent 
implementations of the habit if it is broken.
There exists a set of habits that can be built from the ground up to the top of Maslow’s hierarchy, 
perhaps in a varied order depending on the work of a person. The aim of this work is to document 
those habits and provide a means of realizing them for one who has nothing beyond the skin on their 
back and is stranded on a beach [1]. Most readers will start in a position better off, but indeed writing 
the by establishing habits one-by-one was the aim. For example writing and edition were determined 
to be separate but interdependent tasks with separate needs, and life without running water or 
electricity forced me to find ways to get by that calls those items luxuries.

Physics
Quantify processes
Establish bounds (global).
This may be more prominent in the Security book where we explore models.
“The Physics of Homelessness” was the original title of the work, but this book became just the first 
volume because it’s quite the undertaking. Algebra is a component of physics, so indeed this work 
could be the Algebra of Homelessness, but indeed the material applies to a wider range of people including the professionals who live in their car by choice or due to bumps in life such as myself 
(likely paying light karma).
Psychology, Sociology
Behavior, incentives. (individual, groups).
Bad Apple vs. Bad Basket.
Expected behavior in civilized society. Camping contexts such as Tenderloin vs. Sunset.
Masow’s
Inform development and motivation
The physics of homelessness, bottom layer. Habits and resources required to realize the first layer. 
Ways to acquire those resources and order of operations.
Government public face
Implement processes and draw glossary
Corporate trainings
Glossary. Behaviour. Expectations.
Inform operations. Eg. bathroom parasite.
Operations research in developing corporate training manuals.
Computer Science
Processes and methods.
Develop solutions to extend bounds in operations… “bend the physics”. (of H).
Game of Life
Chosen ones. Monastic living elevates the mind.Membership in the 0.0018%. (was: 0.0024%; 6 vs. 8 billion).
Incentives to distract.
Fail-safe routines. Eg. failure to pick up the phone.
Imagine playing a game of The Sims where instead of starting with $20k you start with $0. Where 
would you sleep and shower? How would you find a job using just mail service and a phone [1].

Legal publications
Common for ____ discipline___. (don’t know what don’t know).
Conservation of Energy (Law of Karma)
The conservation of energy means that each action has an equal and opposite reaction, and indeed the 
word Karma means action. The Bible does not explicitly use the word Karma, but it is a book of 
Justice and Money which represents balance and energy flow. The activities required for life will 
always be allowed without creating non-beneficial reactions, and indeed doing the work to maintain 
oneself to a Godly standard invites beneficial reactions from others who are pleased by the sight of 
God—except of course for the demonically possessed, who are also free to form prosperous weapons 
against the unrighteous who lack God’s protection. Being dirty or tired or eating junk food open doors
to demonic possession and are disgusting to God who withdraws his protection. A common 
misconception is that God punishes, when in fact he protects and Lucifer petitions him for permission
to punish (God of creation vs. god of the earth).
