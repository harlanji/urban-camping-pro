# Urban Camping Pro - Guide

Urban camping pro is a survival guide for professionals living
the VanLife and unhoused / homeless people alike.

It focuses on the foundational activities to life off grid
within an urban environment, which can form the basis of a
system of habits that lead to growth beyond one's present
circumstances in an energy efficient manner.

The laws governing camping and giving apply.

## State

This is the second draft.

The sections were directly copy and pased from the PDF into 
Mardown files on 2022-05-16.

The Markdown hasn't been formatted and tables and images
need to be linked in. It was literally a copy and paste job
which itself took about a half a day.

The file-per-section source layout makes it easy for people to
concurrently edit and own parts of the work.

The largest change from the first draft is that much of the
material not directly related to satisfying Layer 1 of Maslow's
hierachy of needs has been omitted to be the basis of a dedicated
work.

## Direction

The original draft was written in LibreOffice over aobut 6 weeks, 
and edited on a few occasions over the next year.

From converting it to Markdown we can accept pull requests and 
translate it into the LibreOffice work easily.

The next step is to adopt something like Pandoc to compile the e-book
directly as PDF for print, HTML for web, and Mobi/ePub for Kindle 
and similar.

The material cut between the first and second draft will go into another
resource titled to the effect of "Doing Business While Homeless."

## Contribution

For now we can accept a pull request against the markdown file, 
or an email with the changed sections to the address listed on
[the website](https://harlanji.com/urban-camping-pro).

In terms of financial contributions, a Venmo gift to harlanji helps
greatly.
